    description: "The Mitsubishi Outlander Sport (known as the ASX or RVR in other markets) was introduced for the 2011 model year as a compact crossover positioned below the standard Outlander in size and price. Built on a shortened version of the Outlander's GS platform shared with the Lancer, it featured distinctive styling with Mitsubishi's 'jet fighter' front grille design, a sloping roofline, and compact dimensions appealing to urban buyers. In North America, it was powered by a 2.0L four-cylinder engine (4B11) producing 148 horsepower, with a larger 2.4L option (4B12) added in 2015 generating 166-168 horsepower. Transmission options included a five-speed manual (later discontinued) and continuously variable transmission (CVT), with both front-wheel drive and all-wheel drive configurations available using Mitsubishi's All Wheel Control (AWC) system. The interior offered straightforward design with a focus on functionality, though higher trims included features like a panoramic glass roof, push-button start, and available navigation. The model received numerous facelifts throughout its long production run: first facelift in April 2012 with revised front fascia, 2015 model year updates with LED daytime running lamps and new wheels, November 2015 introducing the 'Dynamic Shield' design language, and a third facelift unveiled in February 2019 for the 2020 model year with updated front styling, new 18-inch alloy wheels, and an upgraded infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Standard safety features expanded over time to include seven airbags, stability control, and advanced driver assistance systems. Despite its compact exterior dimensions, the Outlander Sport provided a relatively spacious cabin with flexible seating and cargo arrangements. Production for the North American market continued through 2023, making it one of Mitsubishi's longest-running models in the region."

    description: "The second-generation Mitsubishi Outlander Sport represents a significant step forward, built on the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance CMF-B platform shared with the second-generation Renault Captur. This new platform brings substantial improvements in ride quality, interior space, and efficiency compared to the previous GS-platform vehicle. The exterior features Mitsubishi's latest interpretation of the Dynamic Shield design language with a bold front fascia, distinctive LED lighting signatures, and more contemporary proportions while maintaining the compact crossover identity. The vehicle is slightly larger than its predecessor but remains positioned below the standard Outlander in Mitsubishi's lineup. Powertrain options include a 1.5-liter turbocharged three-cylinder engine (TCe 130) producing approximately 158-161 horsepower, paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT) or a 6-speed manual transmission in some markets. A mild hybrid (MHEV) version is also available in European markets, offering improved fuel efficiency and reduced emissions. All-wheel drive continues to be available through an updated version of Mitsubishi's All Wheel Control (AWC) system with improved torque vectoring capabilities. The interior represents a significant advancement with higher quality materials, a driver-focused cockpit featuring a 10.25-inch touchscreen infotainment system with wireless smartphone integration (Apple CarPlay and Android Auto), a fully digital instrument cluster on higher trims, and greatly improved connectivity options. Safety technology expands substantially with Mitsubishi's latest driver assistance systems including adaptive cruise control, lane keeping assist, automatic emergency braking with pedestrian and cyclist detection, blind spot monitoring, rear cross traffic alert, and a 360-degree camera system. The second-generation Outlander Sport maintains its position as Mitsubishi's entry-level crossover while offering substantially improved refinement, technology, and efficiency compared to its predecessor, benefiting from the shared development resources of the Alliance partnership."
