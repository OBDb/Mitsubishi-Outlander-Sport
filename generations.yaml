    description: "The Mitsubishi Outlander Sport (known as the ASX or RVR in other markets) was introduced as a compact crossover positioned below the standard Outlander in size and price. Built on a shortened version of the Outlander's GS platform, it featured distinctive styling with Mitsubishi's 'jet fighter' front grille design, a sloping roofline, and compact dimensions appealing to urban buyers. In North America, it was primarily powered by a 2.0L four-cylinder engine producing 148 horsepower, with a larger 2.4L option added in 2015 generating 168 horsepower. Transmission options included a five-speed manual (later discontinued) and continuously variable transmission (CVT), with both front-wheel drive and all-wheel drive configurations available using Mitsubishi's All Wheel Control (AWC) system. The interior offered straightforward design with a focus on functionality rather than luxury, though higher trims included features like a panoramic glass roof, push-button start, and available navigation. Despite its compact exterior dimensions, the Outlander Sport provided a relatively spacious cabin with flexible seating and cargo arrangements. The model received numerous refreshes throughout its unusually long production run, with significant facelifts in 2013, 2016, and 2020 bringing updated styling, improved technology, and refined powertrains to keep it competitive. Standard safety features expanded over time to include seven airbags, stability control, and eventually, available advanced driver assistance systems. The Outlander Sport became one of Mitsubishi's most successful models in North America due to its combination of practicality, value pricing, and manageable size, appealing to first-time buyers and urban dwellers seeking an affordable crossover with available all-wheel drive."

    description: "The second-generation Outlander Sport represents a complete redesign, now based on the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance CMF-B platform shared with several compact models across the Alliance brands. Substantially modernized compared to its long-running predecessor, it features Mitsubishi's latest interpretation of the Dynamic Shield design language with a bold front fascia, distinctive LED lighting signatures, and more contemporary proportions. Slightly larger than the previous generation but still positioned as a compact crossover below the standard Outlander. Powertrain options include a 1.5-liter turbocharged three-cylinder engine producing approximately 161 horsepower, paired with a continuously variable transmission or available 6-speed manual in some markets. All-wheel drive continues to be available through an updated version of Mitsubishi's All Wheel Control system. The interior represents a significant advancement with higher quality materials, a driver-focused cockpit featuring a larger touchscreen infotainment system with wireless smartphone integration, available digital instrument cluster, and greatly improved connectivity options. Safety technology expands substantially with Mitsubishi's latest driver assistance systems including adaptive cruise control, lane keeping assist, automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, and blind spot monitoring. The second-generation Outlander Sport maintains its position as Mitsubishi's entry-level crossover while offering substantially improved refinement, technology, and efficiency compared to its predecessor, benefiting from the shared development resources of the Alliance partnership."
